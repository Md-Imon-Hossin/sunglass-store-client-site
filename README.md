# Sunglass
Sunglasses protect your eyes by acting as a barrier that reflects UV rays. Sunglasses are the equivalent of sunscreen for your eyes. Aside from being a beach accessory, they protect your eyes from the sun's harmful light rays. Experts recommend that your shades protect your eyes from at least 99% of UV rays . 

* Lens size counts. The larger the lens, the more of your eye it will protect. 
* Darker sunglasses don't always mean they offer more UV protection. 
* They protect your eyes against the sun's UV rays, which could otherwise lead to cataracts.
* Help your future self prevent sun-related eye disease.
* Avoid headaches or migraines .
